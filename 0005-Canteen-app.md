# Canteen Guy

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

<!-- Brief explanation of the proposed contribution. Write your answer below. -->
A mobile app which allows users to order food from a list of available food items. Simple Payment modes - either Cash or UPI. On every order placed, a unique token is generated. Then a push notification is sent to the user when their order is ready. The user can then pick up the food from the canteen showing the token number to the cashier.

## Problem Statement (Step 1)

[problem-statement]: #problem-statement

**What problem are you trying to solve?**

During the lunch break in our college, we see a huge crowd in front of the canteen ordering food. During that peak hour, there is a lot of people ordering food. At times due to too much crowd, it becomes too much hastle to order food which leads to delayed service. Also, there's has been a lot of frauds in payments and food collection as there was no record to keep track of it. One more important thing is during peak hours, if a person wanted to buy a particular food item in the canteen only to find out that isn't available leads to his/her loss of energy and time.

## Design proposal (Step 2)

[design-proposal]: #design-proposal

<!--
This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail, keeping in mind the following:

- Its interaction with other parts of the system is clear
- It is reasonably clear how the contribution would be implemented
- Dependencies on libraries, tools, projects, or work that isn't yet complete
- New API routes that need to be created or modifications to the existing routes (if needed)
- Any breaking changes and ways in which we can ensure backward compatibility.
- Use Cases
- Goals
- Deliverables
- Changes to documentation
- Ways to scale the solution

Ensure that you include examples and code snippets to allow the community to understand the proposed solution. **It would be best if the examples use naming conventions that you intend to use during the actual implementation to suggest changes early on during the development.**

Write your answer below.

### Data Structure

<!--
What kind of changes or additions are required for the particual project base collections
to support this feature. Explain which entities should be added or updated, what new attributes they
need to have and why. Please think well about the naming conventions and how well they play with other
conventions. Try and stay as consistent with existing patterns as much as possible.
-->

### Supporting Libraries

<!--
Which different libraries do we need to support the new features?
Please describe the new library's potential API?
Avoid using 3rd party libraries when possible, if required - explain why.
-->

### Reliability (Tests & Benchmarks)

#### Scaling

<!-- Explain how we will scale this new feature. -->

#### Tests (UI, Unit, E2E)

<!-- 
Explain how we will test the new feature. 
You can use "N/A" if this section is not relevant to your proposal.
-->

### Documentation & Content

<!--

Documentation is vital for making this new feature a success for both developers using the project and the project maintainers.
Please answer the following questions:

1. What **docs** would support this feature?
2. Do we need to update the **contribution guide** with a new section or a supporting tutorial?
3. What **tutorials** (text/video) might help developers understand this feature scope, capabilities, and possible use-cases?

-->

### Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

<!--

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this functionality exist in other software, and what experience has their community had?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other software, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us, whether they are brand new or an adaptation from other software.

Write your answer below.

### Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

<!-- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged? -->

<!-- Write your answer below. -->

### Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

<!-- This is also a good place to "dump ideas" if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but otherwise related. -->

<!-- Write your answer below. -->
- Add Support for more payment options
