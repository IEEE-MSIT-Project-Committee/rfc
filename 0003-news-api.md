## Plan Of Action

[design-proposal]: #design-proposal

We will be dividing the proposal into Five phases :-

### First Phase
This will be the inital phase , we will try to gather all the website as much as we can with different types of news coverage, so that we would have a clear cut idea of what website to scrape data from

### Second Phase
In this phase , we will be making different classes based approach for various categories of news to scrape data.

### Third Phase
In this phase we will optimize our code for better and fast scraping as well as to handle exceptions to minimize crashes , and we will also deploy our package in PyPy official library of python.

### Fourth Phase
In this phase we will make API , so that everyone can use it irrespective of the langauge they code in , as well as deploy it so that everyone can use it.

### Fifth Phase
This will be the last phase , we will connect our api to the database.

### Supporting Libraries
Beautiful Soup and Request -> for web scraping

#### Benchmarks
Our Benchmarks should mainly focus on how fast and hastle free would our api will perform as multiple request at same time can delay the response.

### Documentation & Content
For Documentation, we will list all the website used in this web scraper, as well how to use the api and python package.
