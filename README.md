3. Fill up [Step 1](rfc-template.md#problem-statement) and raise a PR for the members to review. This will help us understand if the feature/change/project is worth pursuing.
4. You will receive feedback on your proposal and once all the comments are addressed, your PR will be marked as `Ready for Design Proposal` or `Changes Proposed` or `Rejected`.
5. Once marked with `Ready for Design Proposal`, fill up [Step 2](rfc-template.md#design-proposal) of the RFC and move the file over to `design/rfc-<your-awesome-idea>.md` and update the PR.
6. After another round of reviews, your PR will be marked as `Accepted` or `Changes Requested`.
